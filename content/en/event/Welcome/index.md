summary: An example talk using Wowchemy's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: 'Why is No. 1 Middle School AP our new starting point? Are there any classmates like me who were unknown in primary school or junior high school, and didnâ€™t even know what their strengths were? When I was in junior high school, my grades were mediocre. I did not have the opportunity or the courage to take the initiative to try to do something for the collective. No. 1 Middle School AP provides students with enough space and opportunities to show themselves, improve themselves in all aspects, and gain more recognition.

   In the year I came to No. 1 Middle School AP, with the care and attention of the teachers, my grades have made great progress. From being admitted to the top of the line to being second in grade at the end of my first year of high school, this is due to the high quality provided by No. 1 Middle School AP. excellent teaching staff and a non-exam-oriented curriculum system. In addition, whether I am working in class affairs or student union, I actively participate in various activities inside and outside the school. My efforts have been highly recognized by my teachers and classmates, which further encourages me to be more positive and contribute to our work. No. 1 Middle School AP is a collective service.

   Not just me, many of your seniors and seniors also discovered their strengths within one or two years of AP in our No. 1 Middle School. With the support and encouragement of teachers, classmates and parents, they planned their own study and life, and gained more knowledge. With good opportunities, I will eventually go to a famous international university. For example, senior Guo Shuyin of the class of 2022 was admitted to the University of California, Berkeley. Many students have won awards in various well-known international academic competitions. I believe that the students here will also discover their own advantages, find their own direction, seize opportunities, and do better than us.'
